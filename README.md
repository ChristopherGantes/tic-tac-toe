# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is my version of Tic-Tac-Toe. I incorporated the use of IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) and Factory Functions. This seperation of concerns allows for easier debugging and cleaner code practices.

I'm currently proud of how it looks. I hope I can understand more graphic design in the futire and gain more front-end experience to make this more playful.

## Future Plans
-Make the page more responsive
-Add more user interaactivity
-Clean up the code more when I get more practice
